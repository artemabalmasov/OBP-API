        "\n",
        "Welcome to the ADIA Lab Structural Break Open Benchmark Challenge! In this challenge, you will analyze univariate time series data to determine whether a structural break has occurred at a specified boundary point.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a Structural Break?\n",
        "\n",
        "A structural break occurs when the process governing the data generation changes at a certain point in time. These changes can be subtle or dramatic, and detecting them accurately is crucial across various domains such as climatology, industrial monitoring, finance, and healthcare.\n",

        "\n",
        "For each time series in the test set, you need to predict a score between `0` and `1`:\n",
        "- Values closer to `0` indicate no structural break at the specified boundary point;\n",
        "- Values closer to `1` indicate a structural break did occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation Metric\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation metric is [ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html), which measures the performance of detection algorithms regardless of their specific calibration.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ROC AUC around `0.5`: No better than random chance;\n",
        "- ROC AUC approaching `1.0`: Perfect detection."
